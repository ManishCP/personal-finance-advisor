## 🏗️ System Architecture

### The Three-Agent Symphony 🎼

Think of our system like a **financial analysis orchestra**, where each agent has a specialized role:

```
🏗️ Agent 1: Document Processor    🧠 Agent 2: Content Analyzer    📊 Agent 3: Analysis Generator
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The "Data Extractor"              The "Smart Categorizer"        The "Insight Generator"

• Reads PDF bank statements       • Handles ambiguous merchants   • Calculates financial metrics
• Parses transaction data         • Uses AI for unclear cases     • Identifies spending patterns  
• Applies basic categorization    • Batch processes efficiently   • Generates actionable insights
• Pure deterministic logic        • One intelligent AI call       • Optional personalized advice

💡 Uses: 0 LLM calls              💡 Uses: 1 LLM call             💡 Uses: 0-1 LLM calls
⚡ Speed: Instant                  ⚡ Speed: 2-3 seconds            ⚡ Speed: 1-2 seconds
🎯 Handles: 70% of transactions    🎯 Handles: 30% of transactions  🎯 Handles: All final analysis
```

### 🎛️ **Coordinator: The Conductor**

The Main Coordinator orchestrates this symphony using **smart routing logic**:

```python
# Deterministic routing - no AI needed for decisions!
if pdf_file_valid:
    agent1_result = document_processor.process(pdf)
    if transactions_found:
        agent2_result = content_analyzer.process(transactions)
        final_result = analysis_generator.process(categorized_data)
    else:
        return "No transactions found"
else:
    return "Invalid file format"
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### 🚀 **Core Technologies**

| Technology | Purpose | Why We Chose It |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **pdfplumber** | PDF Processing | Best Python library for complex PDF parsing |
| **Anthropic Claude** | AI Analysis | Superior reasoning for financial categorization |
| **Streamlit** | Web Interface | Rapid development of beautiful interfaces |
| **Plotly** | Visualizations | Interactive, professional-quality charts |
| **Pydantic** | Data Validation | Ensures AI responses match expected formats |

### 🎯 **Design Principles**

#### **1. Hybrid Intelligence**
```python
# Fast deterministic processing for obvious cases
if "STARBUCKS" in transaction:
    category = "food_dining"  # Instant, $0 cost

# AI for complex cases  
elif transaction_is_ambiguous:
    category = claude_ai.categorize(transaction)  # Smart, minimal cost
```

#### **2. Batch Optimization**
```python
# Instead of multiple AI calls:
for transaction in unclear_transactions:
    ai.categorize(transaction)  # 8 calls = $0.016

# We do smart batching:
ai.categorize_batch(unclear_transactions)  # 1 call = $0.002
```

#### **3. Graceful Degradation**
```python
try:
    ai_result = claude_api.categorize(transactions)
except APIError:
    # System continues working with basic categorization
    fallback_result = apply_default_categories(transactions)
```
